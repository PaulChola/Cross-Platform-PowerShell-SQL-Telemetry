# Cross-Platform PowerShell & SQL Telemetry

## 🔹 Overview

This project is designed to **collect critical endpoint telemetry** such as operating system information, authentication events, and system activity from endpoints (Windows-focused).

Collected data is stored in a **structured SQL database** (SQLite / MariaDB), enabling efficient querying, analysis, and future integration with **SIEM pipelines**.

**Purpose:**  
Support **SOC Analysts** and **Blue Teamers** in detecting suspicious behavior, investigating incidents, and maintaining endpoint visibility.

---

## 🔹 SOC Use Cases

- Detect unauthorized logins or abnormal authentication patterns
- Identify potential privilege escalation activity
- Investigate compromised or suspicious endpoints
- Audit system activity for security and compliance
- Feed structured telemetry into SIEM platforms (Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, Elastic)

---

## 🔹 Features

- Endpoint telemetry collection via PowerShell
- Authentication / session activity logging
- Hostname and OS metadata collection
- SQL-based structured storage
- Lightweight, modular, and extensible
- Designed with SOC workflows in mind

---

## 🔹 Tech Stack

- **PowerShell** – endpoint data collection  
- **SQLite / MariaDB** – structured telemetry storage  
- **Linux / Windows** – analysis environment  
- Optional: **Python** for enrichment and reporting
